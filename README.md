# MasterDesktop
A modern minimalist desktop environment for Arch Linux

### Features
* Slim
* Opacity, shadows, and blurs
* Modern material themeing
* GAPS!
* Tiling
* Shortcut bar acts as a mini process manager
* Per monitor virtual desktops with indicator and bar
* Mobile phone integration
* Update indicator

### Drawbacks
Monitors are limited to 20 for now. Crazy right?! They are too static and config generation is required on install
to make it more flexible.

### Install
The installer for this might not work yet. This has not been tested yet.

```
git clone https://github.com/eb3095/MasterDesktop
cd MasterDesktop
./install.sh
```

Silent Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/eb3095/MasterDesktop
cd MasterDesktop
./install.sh "Alt"
```
The argument is the i3 Mod key. Alt or Win. Case sensitive.

who knows!

This is not ready for use and is being actively worked on. This section will be updated when
the project is further along, stable, and thoroughly tested.
